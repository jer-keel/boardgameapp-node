# Boardgameapp - Node Version
This is a clone of the boardgame app but instead of using a LAMP stack this one uses a (M)EAN Stack. (M)EAN stands for (Mongo, in parenthesis because for this one we are actually using sqlite), Express, Angular, and NodeJS. This is a practice exercise to learn NodeJS and webdevlopment. 

### Installation
To get this application up and running make sure that NodeJS and npm are installed. Then, clone the repo and run `npm install` while inside the directory. Then simply run `node app.js` and the server will start on `localhost:3000`
